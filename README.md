__GAME INFO__

It is easy, you walk .. eventually you get a gun and you can shoot. Dont let the enemies touch, or you will die and will be forced to start from the
beggining. The game ends with the last letter.  
This game did not really turn out as planned. The game engine literally refused to play any sound. For some reason the mouse wont move for a sec, after I click it.
Althout this could probably be fixed somehow .. but no, I dont think I will.    
The speed of the player will probably need to be altered .. the game was intended to be played slowly, so the default player speed is '200'. For a general
look at the game, or maybe even an attempt to complete it, I'd recommend a speed of at least '1000'. This speed can be found in the player.lua file.    
Most of the code should be commented .. or at least the parts that need to. It does not aim to be flawless, but at least decent enought to get me through and not
dissapoint completely.  
The content of the letters would need a little more thought and a specific mode to be well made, so I have not got to them unfortunately. The rest of the game should somehow work, tho it is very minimalistic and simple. 
The map could be made a little better, but I was honestly too lazy to detail it and make it, so it wont load so much unnecessary blocks. All textures are basically stolen.
